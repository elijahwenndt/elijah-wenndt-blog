### What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?
I wish i had more speed and consistancy while coding. My long term goal is to look into and learn about webscraping
### What are you struggling with?
keeping a more consistant schedule
### How do you solve a problem? 
i typically solve a problem by research. i enjoy delving into a topic until i can personally understand the problem at hand
### What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?
a combination of google and youtube! i also have no trouble asking for help when needed!

### What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?
I believe the best way to answer this is using the house example. HTML is like the structure of the house. It gives the structure and definitions for the rest of the house to function. The CSS is like the design and paint. While not necessary to a websites function, it can make it usuable for an average user and keep the page contents organized. Javascript is like the electricity and plumbing. While everything else is useful and necessary the javascript is what makes the page run. 
### What are some objects that your blog incorporates?
So far nothing much. I currently have an image posted but i will update the blog as we progress!
### What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?
pseudocoding is a powerful tool that can help you break down a complicated problem without having to directly have an answer in the language you are using. It is a great and necessary first step when working on a coding project.

### What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?
a combination of the help channel in slack, the instructors being available to answer questions, and the structure of the assignments given out through google with accompanying slides to assist in understanding.
### What hindered your progress during Onboarding?
i do not work well by myself. in a purely online learning environment, i struggle with motivation and how to get started with an assignment. working online negatively effects my understanding and accomplishments of tasks assigned. the tools and information provided to us was significant, but i am an in person learner. i need hands on, in-person instruction to feel confident in the assignments and learning materials that are given
### How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?
using a combination of google, the help channel, and collaboration between students has helped me overcome the challenges i have faced during onboarding. specifically being able to collaborate with other students has increased my confidence and understanding of the concepts and materials given so far.

### What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?
There are two things that have held me back this week. The first is my lack of knowledge of proper syntax. I can work out problems logically but eventually I come to a point where I dont know how to write the code itself. With so many ways to solve the same problem I can end up lost in what I actually need to write out. The second issue is my lack of pseudocoding. While many students came together and work problems out on the white board, I didnt transfer that onto a document or piece of paper to refer back to later when our initial solutions did not work out. 
### What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?
I have been struggling with the design aspects. I would like to delve deeper into bootstrap so I can solve issues that arise when attempting to take my design and reproduce it on the page.
### How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?
Significantly better so far. While I still struggle with getting all the required materials done, while in-person i just feel that my retention and skills are increasing exponentially. During remote I felt that while I could complete the assignments given, my understanding of the base material lacked. 
### What is your “Why”?
I have mostly worked labor and labor management positions throughout my life. I have found success in these industries, but would rather not be doing labor as I grow older. throughout my experience i had never experienced injury. on january 18th 2022 a pallet was dropped onto my hand, breaking my finger. This was the first time i had been injured in 10 years. after this injury, and with the convencing of another coworker,  i came to the realization that i need to switch careers if i am going to be healthy and successfull.
